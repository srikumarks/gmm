        <h1>DISCLAIMER</h1> 

        <p>
        This program began as a <b>playground</b> for the idea of modeling the
        audio spectrum of a musical signal as mixture of gaussians after
        frequency remapping. I hope to show it some much needed love when time
        is available, cleanup the code, speed it up, fix bugs, etc.
        <b>Absolutely NO guarantees</b> of utility, let alone bug-freeness for
        now! - Kumar (12 July 2012)
